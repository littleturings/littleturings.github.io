去年，我们计划了第一期课程。[这里][intro]有课程介绍（中文）。<br/>
Last year, we planned our first period of lessons.
Its intro (in Chinese) can be found [here][intro].

2020年1月21日，我和施想在我的母校顾村小学上了第一节课。<br/>
Our first lesson was made by me and Orash (施想)
in my mother school Gucun Primary School on Jan 21, 2020.

我们总共准备上5节课，但是因为疫情的原因，我们无法上剩下的4节课，这一期课程就不得不提前结束了。但依然得到了学生和家长的好评。<br/>
We had planned altogether 5 lessons,
while the epidemic prevented the remaining 4 lessons,
so this period of lessons had ended.
Despite that, we are still praised by the students and their parents.

[这里][lecture_notes]有讲义（包含全部的5节课，中文）。[这里][plan_feedbacks]有教案和教学反馈（中文）。<br/>
The lecture notes (including all 5 lessons, in Chinese)
can be found [here][lecture_notes].
The teaching plans and feedbacks (in Chinese) can be found [here][plan_feedbacks].

我是课上的主讲人，施想担任助教。我们互相合作，课堂高效进行。还有一些挑战：有些同学在有关计算机的基础知识方面非常薄弱，我们需要耐心地教授他们。<br/>
During the lesson, I was the main lecturer, and Orash was the assistant.
We collaborated with each other, which made the lesson efficient.
There were also some challenges. Some of the students were poor in basic computer knowledge,
so we needed to be patient to teach them.
