对于这次的 Python 夏校课程，我们小小图灵社做了精心的准备。<br/>
For this summer school course, our club has been preparing for a long time.

胡姝婧同学负责数据结构基础和算法基础的讲解与教授。<br/>
Ryland is in charge of the explanation of data structure foundation and algorithm foundation.

我(施想)负责 Python 基础操作和算法提高的讲解。<br/>
I(Orash) am responsible for the explanation of Python basic operations and the algorithm improvement.

詹有丘同学负责部分答疑工作与 Python 元编程的讲解。<br/>
Ulysses is responsible for part of the Q&A work and the explanation of Python metaprogramming.

我们的课程主要围绕着 Robert Sedgewick 和 Kevin Wayne的《算法》一书来做讲解。在8次课中，深入浅出的讲解了《算法》一书的大部分内容，使没接触过编程的同学也对基础的算法有深入的了解。<br/>
Our course mainly revolves around Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne's *"Algorithm"* to teach. In 8 classes, we explained most of the content of the book "Algorithms" in simple and simple ways, and I believe the students who have not been exposed to programming also learned and made sense of the basis of algorithms.

在这次活动中，我们锻炼了自己的表达能力，规划能力，同时为新生提供免费的课程服务。在我们的讲解下，我相信新生们已经对算法有着深入的理解。我们作为部分学生的计算机启蒙老师，希望能激发起他们们对新事物的好奇心以及对计算机科学这门学科的热爱！<br/>
In this summer session, we exercised our expression and planning skills, and provided free course services for freshmen. Under our explanation, I believe that the freshmen already have a deep understanding of algorithms. As a computer enlightenment teacher for some of the students, we hope to inspire new students' interest in new things and, most importantly, the love for computer science!
