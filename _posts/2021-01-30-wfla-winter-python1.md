在本次活动过程中，我作为Python零基础入门课程的主讲人，为同学们介绍了Python语言的基础内容。<br/>
During the process of this activity,
as the main lecturer of the Python beginners tutorial,
I introduced some basic contents to the students.

课程中的所有内容都是由我自己整理的。<br/>
All of the contents that are used in the course were arranged by me.

课程的主要内容包括Python环境搭建、基本数据类型、基本数据结构、控制结构、函数、面向对象等内容。<br/>
The course mainly consisted of the environment establishment of Python, basic data types, basic data structures,
control flows, functions, OO, etc.

在活动过程中，我们还录制了[视频](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1X5411E7vQ)。<br/>
We also recorded [the videos](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1X5411E7vQ) during the session.

我还在课后完成对同学们进行的答疑工作，在这一过程中为同学们补充他们在课上遗漏的知识。<br/>
I was also responsible for the Q&A work after class.
In this process, I help students to complement the missing knowledge in class.

在这次活动中，我锻炼了自己的表达能力、规划能力，同时为新生提供免费的课程服务。在我的讲解下，我相信新生们已经对Python语言有着初步的理解。我作为部分学生的编程启蒙老师，希望能激发他们对新事物的好奇心以及对计算机科学这门学科的热爱。<br/>
In this activity, I exercised my ability of expressing and planning,
and provided free course services for the students.
I believe that, after attending the courses, the students have already had a basic understanding of Python the language.
I, as the enlightenment teacher in programming for some of the students,
hope to inspire new students' interest in new things,
and, most importantly, the love for computer science.
